# Pocket_Pong
Pocket Pong (Pong for original Game Boy) by Boniato82. Using C language and GBDK.

I'm not a developer, I just know a bit of C/C++, so I thought I could change/improve certain aspects of Classic Pong with time and trying to understand source code.

Anyway, it's so sad that there wasn't an official pong game for original Game Boy (DMG, Pocket, Light), so this is my contribution, because I love Game Boy AND Pong.
