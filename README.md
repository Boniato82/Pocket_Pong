# Pocket_Pong
Pocket Pong (Pong for original Game Boy) by Boniato82. Using C language and GBDK.

Based on Ping-Pong Diplomacy by jduranmaster.

First of all I would like to thank jduranmaster for his code and effort. I'm not a developer, I just know a bit of C/C++, so I thought I could change/improve certain aspects of Ping-Pong Democracy with time and trying to understand source code.

Anyway, it's so sad that there wasn't an official pong game for original Game Boy (DMG, Pocket, Light), so this is my contribution, because I love Game Boy AND Pong game.
